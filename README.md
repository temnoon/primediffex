## Prime Difference Explorer

Prime Explorer is a Python project that explores the properties of prime numbers. It generates prime numbers, calculates their second differences and second ratios, identifies specific sets of primes (such as twin primes, cousin primes, and others), and writes these results to various output files.

## How to Run the Prime Difference Explorer

1. Ensure that you have Python 3.6 or later installed.

2. Install the required Python packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal. (This only needs to install sympy)

3. Modify the `config.json` file to specify your desired parameters for the prime number generation and analysis. The parameters you can specify are described in the "Configuration Parameters" section below.

4. I run the software with "primes, sd, sr, sd_sr_combinations, named_prime_sets = run_from_config('config.json')" in a Jupyter notebook, connected to the home directory of the app. 

5. The script will generate the prime numbers and perform the analyses as specified in your `config.json` file. The results will be written to output files in the same directory as the script.

## Configuration Parameters

In the `config.json` file, you can specify the following parameters:

- `num_bits`: The bit length of the generated primes. 

- `num_primes`: The number of primes to generate.

- `start_number`: The starting number for the prime number generation. If "random", a random start number will be chosen.

- `output_primes`: Whether to output a CSV file with the last 10 digits of each prime number, its second difference, and its second ratio.

- `output_second_differences`: Whether to output a CSV file with the counts and percentages of the second differences.

- `output_second_ratios`: Whether to output a CSV file with the counts and percentages of the second ratios.

- `output_sd_sr_combinations`: Whether to output a CSV file with the counts of the second difference-second ratio combinations.

- `output_named_prime_sets`: Whether to output a CSV file with the named prime sets (pairs of primes with specific gaps).

- `output_named_prime_sets_totals`: Whether to output a CSV file with the total counts of the named prime sets.

- `miller_rabin_iterations`: The number of iterations to use in the Miller-Rabin primality test.

## Output Files

The output files that can be generated by Prime Explorer are as follows:

-  Output Directory named [number of bits]'bits'[number of primes][timestamp]
   inside the output directory are the following files. 

- 'README.md': has information about the dataset, notably the full prime number, and the most significant digits of the prime that can be concatenated onto the left of the truncated primes which are used in the other output files. This keeps massive primes from taking up unnecessary space in the files. 

- `primes.csv`: Contains the last 10 digits of each prime number, its second difference, and its second ratio.

- `second_differences.csv`: Contains the counts and percentages of the second differences.

- `second_ratios.csv`: Contains the counts and percentages of the second ratios.

- `sd_sr_combinations.csv`: Contains the counts of the second difference-second ratio combinations.

- `named_prime_sets.csv`: Contains the named prime sets (pairs of primes with specific gaps, like 'twin primes').

- `named_prime_sets_totals.csv`: Contains the total counts of the named prime sets.

## Loading the Pickle File

Prime Explorer saves its state to a pickle file after each run. You can load this pickle file to inspect the state of the Prime Explorer at the end of its last run.

Here's a Python snippet that loads the pickle file:

```python
import pickle

with open('state.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    state = pickle.load(f)

# `state` is now a dictionary that contains the primes, second differences, second ratios, 
# second difference-second ratio combinations, and named prime sets generated in the last run.
```

Replace `'state.pkl'` with the path to your pickle file if it's different.
